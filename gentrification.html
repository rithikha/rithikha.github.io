								The term “gentrification” was first coined in 1964 by british sociologist Ruth Glass as she observed the changes occurring
								 around her home in North London:

								<blockquote style="line-height:1rem;"><font size="-1"> “One by one, many of the working class neighbourhoods of London have been
																		invaded by the middle-classes— upper and lower. Shabby, modest mews and cottages— two rooms up and two
																		down— have been taken over, when their leases have expired, and have become elegant, expensive
																		residences ... Once this process of 'gentrification' starts in a district it goes on rapidly, until
																		all or most of the original working-class occupiers are displaced and the whole social character of
																		the district is changed.”
																	</font></i>
								</blockquote>
								Gentrification is a complex issue that is closely tied to inequality and at surface level, it may manifest as the revitalization
								 of a neighbourhood. However, upon closer examination, this revitalization is usually accompanied by the displacement of the original residents,
								 homogenization of neighbourhood demographics, increases in housing prices, and new amenities and services that are only accessible to
								 higher-income residents.
								 <br>
								 <br>
								 Many urbanists, such as Jane Jacobs, believe that gentrification can be beneficial in small amounts. This "positive" gentrification, also known
								 as internal gentrification or incumbent upgrading, helps kickstart an inclusive revitalization process. In comparison, "negative"
								 or external gentrification is one that kills diversity and displaces marginalized communities.

								 <h2>GENTRIFICATION IN VANCOUVER, BC</h2>

								 This is a two part research series exploring negative gentrification in Vancouver, British Columbia, a city internationally known for both its diversity
								 and inequality:
								 <br>
								<br>
								 PART 1 uses four common indicators of negative gentrifying change to identify which of Vancouver’s neighbourhoods are currently gentrified
								 or are gentrifying. Patterns in gentrifying change are also identified over a 10 year time period from 2006 to 2016.
								 <br>
								 PART 2 of the study explores which characteristics of a neighbourhood best predicts future gentrification using a geographically weighted
								 regression. By dissecting gentrification into social, economic, and place-based components, this study aims to identify avenues for proactively addressing its
								 negative effects.
