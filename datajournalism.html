				<h1 style="color:black;">RETHINKING RESILIENCE <i> </i></h1>

				<div>
					<p>
						<br>
						In the last two decades, the number of scientific papers whose titles contain the word
						‘resilience’ has increased by more than 98%. While the term has become ubiquitous across
						nearly all fields of work and study, resiliency, as it is currently understood and implemented
						in disaster-planning today, often fails those who are most in need of it.
						<br>
						<br>
						In 1973, Canadian ecologist Crawford Stanley Holling was the first to introduce the concept
						of resilience to mainstream academia. Though commonly defined as the ability of an entity to
						rebound after an extreme event, either to its prior condition or a functional state, Holling’s
						definition was much richer. From his observations in ecological management, he saw
						resilience as more than just adaptation or finding new ways to achieve the same goals.
						Rather, his definition encompassed the concept of transformation, or the ability of an entity to
						create new goals and pathways for development as opposed to returning to previous
						baselines.
						<br>
						<br>
						Wedged between Jamaica Bay and the North Atlantic Ocean is The Rockaways, a thin
						peninsula extruding from the borough of Queens in New York City. Racial and economic
						disparity runs deep here, largely a result of post-World War II zoning laws and policies which
						housed low-income residents on cheap, isolated, and unsurprisingly, physically vulnerable
						land. Urban Renewal projects in the late 1950’s, led by then head of the Mayor's Committee
						on Slum Clearance, Robert Moses, helped further steepen the area’s disparity gradient. Now,
						Rockaway is home to gated communities on its West end, where the median household
						income is upwards of $82,000, while on the eastern half, residents live on $30,000 or less.
						<br>

						<br>
						<br>
						Similar to the rest of the city, economic patterns of segregation in Rockaway are mirrored in
						its racial divides, both of which were further reinforced by Hurricane Sandy in 2012. With
						most relief funding and resiliency efforts concentrated in the more affluent sections of the
						peninsula, Rockaway’s most vulnerable residents were left without resources to rebuild, let
						alone reinforce their homes in preparation for the next inevitable storm. These polarities in
						investment have also turned the peninsula into a gentrification hotspot. New development has
						attracted wealthier, predominantly white residents to the area, as well as businesses that cater
						to them, while rising costs of living have displaced many of Rockaway’s original residents.
						<br>
						<br>
						Almost 50 years later, Holling’s insights into resilience are more relevant than ever before.
						While disasters harm indiscriminately, socially and economically marginalized communities
						are disproportionately affected due to pre-existing patterns of inequality. What’s more, these
						communities, like Rockaway’s eastside, are also likely to be overlooked in post-disaster
						recovery and resiliency efforts, further propagating disparity.
						<br>
						<br>
						After Hurricane Sandy, New York was the first city in the world to establish a resilience
						strategy and has been deemed a “living laboratory for urban resilience” by the now disbanded
						100 Resilient Cities program funded by the Rockefeller Foundation. However, more than 8
						years later, ‘resilience’ may be little more than a buzzword to the city’s residents who are
						currently grappling with the coronavirus pandemic, a disaster of a much different kind and
						scale than Sandy. The situation has, once again, woefully exposed deep-seated inequality in
						cities like New York, whose death rate for black and latino residents is twice as high as it is
						for their white counterparts. However, these current struggles also provide an opportunity to
						transform existing systems and adopt new strategies for resilience. Strategies that ask why some people are pushed
						towards the breaking point morethan others and that allow communities to address underlying disparities, rather than build on top of them.

						Created using Mapbox GL JS, this web map visualizes the public transportation networks of Toulouse, the fourth-largest city in France.
						Social and physical mobility are linked in many ways and as cities continue to increase in size, the accessibility and quality of
						their transportation infrastructure will be crucial in creating more equitable, healthy urban environments, as well as happier communities.
						This map was designed to highlight the major forms of public transport available in Toulouse, such as metro lines, trams, and bus routes, along with
						2016 census population density data.
