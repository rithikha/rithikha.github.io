<b> PAPER REVIEW 1: LANDSCAPE ECOLOGY</b>
<br>

<a href = "https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0169204618300793?via%3Dihub">Spatial scaling of urban impervious surfaces across evolving
	landscapes: From cities to urban regions</a>
	<br>
	<br>
	This paper examines urban impervious surfaces (UIS) and their spatial allometry to understand how they change across 3 different geographical strata:
	the city proper, the metropolitan region, and the urban agglomeration as a whole in 3 Chinese urban regions
<br>

	</div>
	Increasing urbanization and the consequent infrastructure boom has led to the conversion of natural and agricultural land uses into impervious land cover,
	such as rooftops, roads, sidewalks, parking lots, etc. These surfaces divert and prevent the natural absorption and flow of water, leading to challenges such
	as flooding, changes in land-surface energy balance (absorption and emission of longwave radiation), and can put cities at greater risk of developing urban heat
	islands. Increased urban runoff, flooding, decreased water quality and aquatic biodiversity and wetland ecosystems degradation can result due to high impervious
	 surface cover. While increased UIS is an indicator of greater urbanization, tracking their growth over time can also be used to measure of a city’s
	 environmental health.
<br>
<br>
The study was designed to address the following questions:
<br>
1. How do UIS area change with increasing spatial extent across urban administrative levels
<br>
2. How does the total amount and percentage of UIS scale differently in space?
<br>
3.Do the scaling relations of UIS found in the 3 Chinese metropolitan regions apply to other metropolitan regions in the world?
<br>
<br>
The results of this study show that scaling relations vary across the 3 urban hierarchies with UIS area increasing faster than urban area but more
slowly than urban population. The same trends were found at the city proper and metropolitan region scales for 6 different cities around the world.
Various ecological and geographical phenomena are influenced by the scale effect, a type of modifiable areal unit problem (MAUP). From these results,
the authors argue that this urban feature and its effects are best studied using a multiscale approach.
<br>
<br>
<b>Limitations</b>: The authors make no mention of edge effects which would come into play during their analysis of UIS in relation to scale. The satellite
 imagery used for UIS identification was also outdated (2009 data) for a study conducted in 2018 as China’s urban expansion patterns may be different
  now due to different policies and investments in infrastructure.

<b>PAPER REVIEW 2: HEALTH GEOGRAPHY</b>
<br><br>
<a href = "https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/10962247.2016.1143887"> Air quality mapping using GIS and economic evaluation of health impact for Mumbai City, India
</a>
<br>
<br>
The authors of this paper analyzed the seasonal and annual variations in air quality in Mumbai, Maharashtra, the most populated city in India and the fifth most populated in the world.
<br>
<br>
The study had two main goals:
<br>
1. Given that air quality by nature exhibits high temporal and spatial variation and the limited concentration of air quality measuring stations in the city, which
 spatial interpolation methods are most accurate for predicting air quality over the region?
 <br>
2. What are the economic costs of morbidity associated with air pollution?
<br>
<br>
Data on three particular pollutants, sulfur dioxide (SO2), nitrogen dioxide (NO2) and suspended particulate matter (SPM - PM10) were interpolated in various regions
of the city and then compared to observed measurements. Finally, a health impact assessment was conducted within each ward (an administrative subsection of the city)
to estimate the economic cost of air pollution in the area. An estimated 509 billion rupees (9.77 billion CAD) was lost in 2012 due to NO2 and PM10 pollution in
Mumbai which is approximately 4.24% of the entire state of Maharashtra’s GDP.

</div>

<b>Limitations:</b> There were only 7 stations collecting observed data in an area of 438km2 , and the choice of pollutants used were not justified or well thought out as PM2.5 would have been better pollutant to use in this study and SO2 data was not used in part two of study due to lack of literature on its negative health impacts. A major problem with this study is that no mention of the effects of confounding or extraneous variables such as ground pollutants, participant lifestyles, etc was made or acknowledged.

	<b>PAPER REVIEW 3: CRIME ANALYSIS</b>
	<br>
	<br>
	<a href ="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4330869/">The Impact of Green Stormwater Infrastructure Installation on Surrounding
		Health and Safety</a>
		<br>
		<br>
		Based on the broken windows theory, this paper investigates the health and safety effects of urban green stormwater infrastructure (GSI)
		in the city of Philadelphia, Pennsylvania from 2000 to 2012. In criminology, broken windows theory suggests that visible signs of disorder in
		 an environment often lead to and/or encourage further disorder such as crime. Though little has been studied of the mechanism by which broken
		  window theory operates, it is thought that well maintained spaces signal that the area has caretakers and is therefore under some level of
			surveillance. On the other hand, areas showing signs of societal decay may seem neglected by the community and therefore give the sense that
			 further damage will be tolerated.
			 <br><br>Previous studies exploring the possibility of green space in mitigating stress
		and improving coping show that green spaces are associated with a stronger sense of safety and feelings of security. Most of these studies
		have used coarse measures of both nature and safety however, looking at totals of all types of crime or totals of major categories such as
		 violent crime and property crime. This study looks at specific types of crime, namely felonies (homicides, rape, arson, etc), nuisance and
		 property crimes, and narcotics crimes (drug use and possession) and how they are affected by the presence of green stormwater infrastructure
		  across 6 different spatial scales.
			<br>
			<br>
			Four types of green infrastructure:

	</div>
As part of their analysis, the researchers conducted a:
<br>
- <i>Difference-in-differences analysis</i> of the effects of GSI installments on health and safety was conducted. This statistical technique uses
observational data to calculate the effect of the independent variable (green stormwater infrastructure) on the dependent variable (crime incidents)
by comparing the average change over time in crime rates in the treatment group, to the change in the control group.
<br>
- <i>Kernel density estimation</i> was used to account for the location of features relative to each other, however the experimenters tested for spatial
autocorrelation and their Moran’s I (0.36), z-score (0.99), and p-value (0.32) do not indicate that any spatial clustering is present.
<br>
- <i>Mixed-effects regression model</i> was used to compare differences in pre- and post-treatment measures of crime in the treated sites. At the edge of
the city boundary buffers were also used to account for edge effects.
<br><br>
The adjusted regression model showed statistically significant and consistent reductions in narcotics possession across all three geographic
 scales. Narcotics manufacturing and burglaries were also significantly reduced across these three scales, however homicides, assaults, thefts,
public drunkenness, and narcotic sales saw non-significant reductions in at least one of the three
scales.
<br>
<br>
The paper explores an important, and often overlooked aspect of green infrastructure. With a changing climate, stormwater infrastructure is especially
important in cities to mitigate the effects of excess rainfall, sea level rise, and other issues contributing to flooding. However its social benefits
are only now being included in the cost-benefit assessments of GSI programs. This study presents a good case for its consideration when identifying the
locations of GSI’s and its projected impacts on the surrounding geographic area, looking beyond its environmental benefits.
<br>
<br>
<b>Limitations:</b> The effects of private (but publicly visible green space) was not factored in and the the GSI’s were not centred within geographic
boundaries (could lead to spillover effects on other sites).
