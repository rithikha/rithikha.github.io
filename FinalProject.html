								<h1>Predicting Gentrification in Vancouver, BC</h1>
								<h3> Rithikha Rajamohan | GEOB 479 <h3>

	<h2>ABSTRACT</h2>
	<p><strong>Gentrification</strong> is an urban issue closely tied to social equity in cities. While gentrification brings
		 improved or new amenities and services to residents, access to these improvements are often limited to the middle or upper class,
		 thereby exacerbating existing socio-economic silos. This study aims to identify which social, economic and place-based factors best
		 predicts gentrification in Vancouver, BC. A multi-criteria evaluation was first conducted to identify levels of negative neighbourhood
			change from 2010 to 2015. These values were then used alongside ten predictor variables in a geographically weighted regression (GWR).
			An exploratory regression identified median income, median commute time, percent one-person households, percent old buildings, and
			percent apartments under five stories in 2010 as the most significant variables in predicting the amount of gentrifying change
			 experienced by 2015 in a census tract. These variables account for 12% of the variation seen in the model, and median commute time,
				percent apartments under five stories, and percent old buildings were statistically significant (p = 0.01). However, due to
				 multicollinearity, the percent of one-person households was removed for the GWR analysis. The results indicate that much of the
					model variation is unaccounted for by these variables. This study seeks to aid policy makers in identifying which areas are most
					prone to experiencing gentrifying change and inform policies and incentives accordingly. The role of housing, zoning, and building
					 policies, presence of businesses, as well as cultural capital should be explored in the future to see what role they may play in
						advancing or deterring gentrifying forces.</p>
<br><br>
	<h2>Introduction </h2>
	<p><strong>According to Florida (2017) Global cities</strong> such as Washington, D.C., London, Paris, and Vancouver are at the forefront of what is called the
		“new urban crisis” . As inequality soars, marginalized communities are
		 disproportionately impacted by the changes brought on by an influx of affluent residents and lack of opportunities for upward
		 mobility. Both of which are hallmarks of gentrification.
	 <br><br>
	 The term itself was first coined in 1964 by Ruth Glass, a British sociologist and Director of Social Research at University College
		London at the time (Slater, 2012). Watching the changes occurring around her home in a North London district called Islington,
		 she observed that:
		 <br><br>
		 <i> “One by one, many of the working class neighbourhoods of London have been invaded by the middle-classes— upper and lower.
			 Shabby, modest mews and cottages— two rooms up and two down— have been taken over, when their leases have expired, and have
			 become elegant, expensive residences ... Once this process of 'gentrification' starts in a district it goes on rapidly, until all
			 or most of the original working-class occupiers are displaced and the whole social character of the district is changed.”</i>
			 <br><br>
			 Some urbanists, such as Jane Jacobs, believe that gentrification can be beneficial in small amounts. Known as internal
				gentrification or incumbent upgrading, this process kickstarts an internally-powered revitalization process (World Bank, 2002).
				In comparison, external gentrification is one that kills diversity and displaces minorities and low-income groups (World Bank, 2002).
				<br><br>
			 Though the nature of gentrification is different in each city (Anderson, 2017), a number of common neighborhood characteristics
			 have been identified as indicators of gentrification:
			 <br><br>
				- Housing Price<br>
				-	Income<br>
				-	Education Levels<br>
				-	Minority Population Presence<br>
				<br>
				Housing prices and income measure the affordability of an area and the level of housing instability residents face. Increases
				in income and housing prices are indicators of displacement due to well-educated and affluent residents moving into an area and
				inflating property values. Increases in educational attainment also reflect the influx of new, more affluent residents into a
				neighbourhood. Another indication of displacement is when the presence of minority populations diminishes over a short period of
				time. The effect of minority population presence on driving or inhibiting gentrification depends on many factors such as cultural
				beliefs and stereotypes. As such, the relationship between minority groups and gentrification is not always clear or constant. A
				study by Hwang and Sampson (2014) found that neighborhoods with a high percentage of African American residents were less likely
				to gentrify than areas with a high percentage of Latino residents. They found this was due to non-Hispanic white residents’ views of majority black
				neighborhoods.
				<br><br>
				<b>A multi-criteria evaluation </b>was first conducted based off the methodlogy and findings of a previous <a href = "https://rithikha.github.io/Gentrification/">exploration of
				 gentrification</a> and a series of studies by the media platform, <a href ="https://www.governing.com/gov-data/portland-gentrification-maps-demographic-data.html">
				Governing</a>. The MCE study area is the City of Vancouver, BC and the evaluation was conducted in order to calculate
				 gentrification levels for Part 2 of this study, a regression analysis. The following variables were used to identify the amount
				 of gentrifying change occurring in census tracts from 2010 to 2015:</p>

		<ul class="feature-icons">
		<li class="icon fa-signal">  Median Household Income</li>
		<li class="icon fa-signal">  Percent Minority Population</li>
		<li class="icon fa-signal">  Percent Aboriginal Population</li>
		<li class="icon fa-signal">  Percent Educated-Bachelor’s or Above</li>
	</ul>

		<b>Part 2 </b>of this study explores which neighborhood characteristics best predicts future gentrification potential using a geographically weighted
		regression. The following ten predictors were used as independent variables and describe the social, economic, and physical
		characteristics of an area.
		<br><br>
		<i>Social Predictors include measures of population demographics and proxies for social capital in an area.</i><br>

- Minority population<br>
- Aboriginal Population<br>
- Community Centres
<br>
<br>
<i>Economic Predictors are measure of a populations capacity to withstand and mitigate economic shocks and changes.</i><br>
- Renter to Owner Ratio<br>
- Median Household Income<br>

<br>
<i>Physical Predictors are the place-based characteristics of an area. These include type of housing stock,
population density, aesthetic qualities, and accessibility to business districts. </i><br>
- Apartments Under Five Stories<br>
- One Person Households <br>
- Old Buildings<br>
- Population Density<br>
- Median Commute Time to Work<br>
			<!-- <br>
<b>In Part 3 of the study</b>, a grouping analysis is used to identify the location of four different populations in
Vancouver based on median income levels, ethnicity, work commute time, and population density.-->

<br>
Gentrification is often seen as an inevitable part of a neighbourhood’s evolution, with some researchers such as
Brahinksy (2014) identifying gentrification as “our economy’s urban form” (p.52) (Rigolon, Németh, 2019). Ultimately,
this study aims to dissect gentrification into its social, economic, and place-based components in order to identify
the best avenues for addressing its negative effects and support the factors that counteract it.

	<h2>Methodology</h2>
	<b>Base City Map</b> <br><br>
	The census tract shapefile was clipped to the City of Vancouver boundary (ClipCT_2011)<br><br>

<b>Multi-Criteria Evaluation (MCE)</b><br><br>

The MCE methodology was adapted from a previous MCE exploring gentrification, full details can be found
<a href = "https://rithikha.github.io/Gentrification/methodology.html">here</a>
<br><br>
<i>Data Cleaning</i>: Raw census data was normalized into percentages (if necessary) and then cleaned into columns with
appropriate headers in Microsoft Excel. The 2016 income and housing prices were divided by a factor of 1.07 to account
for inflation since 2011.
<br><br>
<div class="box alt">
	<div class="row gtr-uniform">
		<div class="col-8"><span class="image fit"><img src="images/fp1.png" alt="" /></span></div>
	</div>
</div>
The 2011 and 2016 datasets were then imported into the geodatabase and joined by attribute table value
(CTUID) to ClipCT_2011. Five new fields for the changes in the five variables were created in the attribute table
 and using the attribute calculator,  percent change occurring from 2011 to 2016 was calculated for the median
 income and housing price fields. The using the following equation was used for these variables:
<br><br>
	Equation 1.   ((2016X  –  2011X) / 2011X) * 100
<br><br>
The change in the minority population, aboriginal population, and highly educated population was calculated using equation 2 as their values already existed as percentages:
<br><br>
Each MCE variable was then converted to raster format using the Polygon to Raster Tool  and the following inputs:
<br><br>
	Equation 2.   2016X – 2011X
	<br><br>
	Each MCE variable was then converted to raster format using the <b>Polygon to Raster Tool</b>  and the following inputs:
	<div class="box alt">
		<div class="row gtr-uniform">
			<div class="col-8"><span class="image fit"><img src="images/fp2.png" alt="" /></span></div>
		</div>
	</div>

	Using the <b>Fuzzy Membership Tool</b>, the rasters were then normalized to a
	scale of 0 (weak set membership) to 1 (strong set membership) through a fuzzy
	 <b>Linear Membership</b> function. A <b>Somewhat Hedge</b> was used and the
	 minimum and maximum values were specified appropriately with an inversion of
	 the percent change in minority population and aboriginal population minimum
	 and maximum values.
<br><br>
An equally weighted overlay was created from the fuzzified rasters to produce
the final MCE raster.
<br><br>
In order to use these gentrification values in an ordinary least squares and geographically weighted regression, the MCE raster needed to be converted to a feature class.
<br><br>
As the <b>Raster to Feature tool</b> requires integer raster values, the following steps were taken to convert the MCE floating point values.
<br><br>
First, decimal places were removed from the MCE gentrification values by multiplying by a factor of 100,000 using the <b>Raster Calculator tool</b>.
The <b>Int Tool</b> was then used to convert the floating point values to integers. Finally the <b>Convert Raster to Feature </b>tool (using all defaults) was used to create a shapefile with an attribute table for the gentrification values.



<br><br>
<b> Geographically Weighted Regression</b>
<br><br>
<i>Data Cleaning</i>: Raw 2011 census data was normalized and modified as necessary (renter to owner ratio was calculated). Census Tract 9330058.00 did not have any associated census data for the apartments under five stories and number of one-person households variables. Given that the CT lies within the Strathcona neighbourhood, the following average neighbourhood values for these two variables were given to the CT:
<br><br>
2011 Apartments under five stories (normalized) =  0.43 <br>
2011 one-person households (normalized)  = 0.587
<br><br>
The dataset was imported into the geodatabase and again joined by CTUID to a new ClipCT_2011 layer. Two shapefiles containing points
representing community centres were <b>spatially joined</b> to ClipCT_2011 using a <b>One-to-One</b> join operation and the
 <b>Sum</b> merge rule. The MCE gentrification value feature class was <b>spatially joined</b> using a <b>One-to-Many</b>
 join operation and a <b>Median</b> merge option.
<br><br>
Once the final attribute table was created, three regression tools <b>from ArcMap’s Modeling Spatial Relationships Toolset</b> were used with the following inputs:

<br><br>
<u>Exploratory Regression Tool</u>
<ul>
<li><b>Dependent Variable: </b>GentValue</li>
<li><b>Candidate Explanatory Variables: </b>ApU5, F1hous, OldB, RentOwn, Inc, Minor, Abg, Commute, PopDen, and ComCen</li>

<li><b>Candidate Variables</b>: ApU5, F1hous, OldB, Commute, and Inc</li>
<li><b>Output feature class and output report file specified</b></li>
</ul>

Informed by the results of the OLS and exploratory regression, a GWR was conducted using the the variables with
the highest adjusted r-squared value, lowest AICc values, and lowest multicollinearity values.
The <b>Polygon to Points tool </b>was first used to convert the CT polygons into points located at the center of each census tract.

<h2>Results & Discussion</h2>
<b>Multi-Criteria Evaluation</b> <br><br>
The MCE results show that the highest amounts of gentrifying change occurred in census tracts located within the
 neighbourhoods of Strathcona, Grandview woodland, Kensington- Cedar Cottage, Shaughnessy, and Fairview. The lowest
  values are found in hastings- Sunrise, Kitsilano, Dunbar-Southlands, Killarney, Renfrew-Collingwood, and
	the West End Neighbourhoods.

		</div>
	</div>

	<b>Explanatory Regression</b>
	<br><br>
	The results of the exploratory regression indicate that of the ten predictor variables, the percent apartments
	under five stories, percent one-person households, percent old buildings, median income, and median commute
	time best account for the variation in the model (Adjusted R-squared = 0.12; lowest AICc value = 3334.75).


		<div class="box alt">
			<div class="row gtr-uniform">
				<div class="col-8"><span class="image fit"><img src="images/fp4.png" alt="" /></span></div>
			</div>
		</div>

		Of these five variables, four are place-based predictors highlighting the physical characteristics of an
		area, with apartments under five stories, percent one-person households, and median commute time being
		statistically significant (p = 0.01). One economic predictor, median household income, was also included
		 in the best model, however no social predictors were identified.
		<br><br>

		<div class="box alt">
			<div class="row gtr-uniform">
				<div class="col-4"><span class="image fit"><img src="images/fp5.png" alt="" /></span></div>
					<div class="col-4"><span class="image fit"><img src="images/fp6.png" alt="" /></span></div>
			</div>
		</div>

		The exploratory variables significance summary shows that both percent aboriginal population and percent
		minority population are positively, and almost identically correlated with gentrification values (% negative
		correlation = 11.33 & 12.89; % positive correlation = 88.67 & 87.11 respectively). This indicates that the
		strength of minorities and aboriginal populations in an area have the same effect on gentrification levels.
		Although, in a global city such as Vancouver, it may be worth dissecting minority groups to see if specific
		ethnicities have different relationships to gentrification.
		<br><br>
		Median commute time, percent one-person households, percent old buildings, and median income are negatively
		correlated to gentrification levels. Shorter commuting time to work could be a result of a beign situated closer to business districs,
		 which would increase the attractiveness of an area to higher-income residents. The results for
		one-person households were surprising as previous studies have shown that gentrified neighborhoods contain more
		 one-person households and households with unrelated adults (Furman Center, 2015). The relationship between
		 one-person households and gentrification could be influenced by other trends, such as changing lifestyles and
		 attitudes towards marriage which would affect the demand for certain types of housing stock (Bachman & Darua, 2015). The relationship between
		 building age and gentrification was also contrary to the findings of previous studies which found older building
		 stock to be a gentrification attractor (Cline, 2017). This relationship may be context-specific as well.
		 The availability or construction of new housing stock in different areas of the city due to zoning laws may play some role in this
		 negative correlation. Numerous studies support the negative relationship between income and gentrification,
		 showing that lower income areas are more likely to gentrify, largely due to the lower housing values. Lower-income
		  residents are also more likely to be displaced due to housing appreciation after an influx of middle and upper
			class residents (Atuesta & Hewings, 2018).
		<br><br>
		Percent of apartments under five stories is positively correlated with gentrification. Apartments under five stories
		represent cheaper housing stock, and possibly degraded areas where developers find greater opportunity for new housing
		development or redevelopment. The currently gentrifying Strathcona neighbourhood reflects this observation. The neighbourhood
		has one of the the highest percentages of apartments under five stories in the city and this type of housing stock would also be more
		 affordable for low-income groups, making it more susceptible to gentrifying forces.
		<br><br>

All maximum variance inflation factors (VIF) were under the acceptable threshold of 4 (source), except for percent one-person
households (VIF = 4.63) which indicates that the model may be unreliable due to multicollinearity. This variable was not
included in the geographically weighted regression.
<br><br>

<b>Ordinary Least Squares Regression</b>
<br><br>
The OLS regression results expand on these relationships within the model.
<br><br>

<div class="box alt">

		<div class="col-8"><span class="image fit"><img src="images/fp7.png" alt="" /></span></div>
	</div>
</div>

<br>
The coefficient values are highest for the one-person households, apartments under five stories, and old buildings, indicating
 the strength between these explanatory variables and gentrification values is the strongest. The weakest relationship is between
  median income and gentrification values.
<br>

</div>


<br>
The OLS Multiple R-squared value is 0.16 and 0.12 for the adjusted R-squared value. The F-Statistic, a measure of overall model
significance is trustworthy as the Koenker (BP) statistic is not statistically significant. As the F-statistic is significant
this indicates that the explanatory variables in the model are effective (ESRI, n.d.).
<br><br>
The Jarque–Bera Statistic is statistically significant however, indicating that the model is biased. This could be due to four
 reasons: model misspecification, the presence of non-linear relationships within the model, heteroskedasticity, or influential
  outliers in the data. Model misspecification is highly likely as a number of variables were not included due to data accessibility and time constraints.
A non-linear relationship between the variables used in the regression is also a strong possibility. Model bias is reflected in the
 variable histograms which are all skewed. The scatterplots for the variables do not have any strong diagonal patterns which indicate
 non-linear relationships are likely occurring.
<br><br>

<div class="box alt">

			<div class="col-4"><span class="image fit"><img src="images/fp11.png" alt="" /></span></div>
	</div>
</div>

Finally, the OLS standard histogram residual reflects the over and under predictions of the model. The model is skewed from a normal
distribution and as indicated by the Jarque-Bera p-value, the model is significantly biased.  The residual scatterplot highlights problems
 with non-stationarity (which is addressed in geographically weighted regressions but not in OLS) and heteroskedasticity. Heteroskedasticity
  is likely an issue as the scatterplot is cone shaped, indicating that the model predicts better in areas with high gentrifying change
	values, than those with lower values.
<br><br>

<b>Geographically Weighted Regression</b>

<br><br>
The GWR results are summarized in the table below. Overall the model has a multiple R-squared value of 0.12,
and an adjusted R-squared value of 0.04. The adjusted R-squared value is adjusted for the number of predictors in the model, which results in a value that is always lower
 than the multiple R-squared value. However, the model’s Adjusted R-squared is much lower and may indicate that some variables improve the
 model by less than what is expected by chance (non-statistically significant variables such as percent old buildings and median household income.
<br><br>

<div class="box alt">
	<div class="row gtr-uniform">
		<div class="col-8"><span class="image fit"><img src="images/fp12.png" alt="" /></span></div>
	</div>
</div>


The GWR residuals were checked for spatial autocorrelation (Moran’s I) and the over and under predications of the model are randomly distributed.
Since clustering does not occur, model mispecification is likely not an issue.
<br><br>

<div class="box alt">

</div>

The output coefficient rasters highlight the spatial variation in the explanatory variables and can be used to determine at which
administration level policies would be best implemented (local or regional variation). Areas where the coefficients are the greatest
 indicate a strong relationship to the gentrification values at those locations. Variation in the four variable coefficients is largely
 at the city scale, with high and low values encompassing more than one neighbourhood in all cases.
<br><br>

The R-squared values show local model fit over the census tracts. The model performs well in the Eastern section of the city and fairly
 poorly in the western section of the city. It performs very poorly in the upper middle are of the city (South Cambie, Riley park, and
 the southern section of the Mount Pleasant neighbourhood).

<h2>Sources of Error  & Opportunities for Improvement</h2>
<p>
<b>1 </b>The multi-criteria evaluation conducted to attain gentrification values for the regression was based on the assumption that census tracts began to gentrify starting in 2010. In reality, some tracts could have already gentrified by 2010 or started to gentrify before or after 2010. To address this, change in gentrification levels (negative neighbourhood change) was calculated over a period of 5 years, from 2010 to 2015 rather than a snapshot of gentrification at a certain time period. This helps in reducing errors if this model is used in to explore gentrification in cities for comparison.
<br><br>
<b>2 </b>Census tract data was also missing from areas of the city such as Downtown and the area near the University of British Columbia’s campus. Both are important areas as the former acts as a main commercial and housing hub, and the latter may play a role in gentrifying surrounding neighbourhoods and increasing inequality due to the combination of subsidized housing, mixing of the creative classes, and increased demand for better neighbourhood services (Florida, 2015).
<br><br>
<b>3 </b>The Jarque – Bera Statistic is statistically significant indicating the model is biased. Furthermore, the scatterplots indicate that a non-linear relationship may exist within the model. The study could be improved by expanding the candidate variables used and accounting for non-linear relationships by transforming the data. A geographically weighted regression may not be the best statistical tool to model the relationships between the predicter variables and gentrification levels so different regression techniques should be explored to see which has the best fit.
<br><br>

<b>4 </b>This study used economic, social, and place-based variables to explore gentrification and why it occurs where it does. Furthermore, policy related variables were not included in the study due to time and access constraints. Housing and development policies or activities in the City of Vancouver such as community amenity contributions (CAC’s) and number of re-zoning applications would be important variables to consider as they likely influence all three types (economic, social, and place) variables.
<br><br>
<b>5 </b>The model mainly identified place-based characteristics (4/5 of the final variables included in the model) and one economic variable. No social factors were included in the Explanatory regression results. The reasons for which would be worth exploring more, especially the role of cultural capital in influencing gentrification.
<br><br>

<h2>Conclusion</h2>
<p>
A geographically weighted regression was conducted using four place-based variables, median commute time, percent buildings built in 1981 or before, and percent apartments under five stories, and one economic variable, median household income. Together these four variables account for 12% of the variation seen in the model (Multiple R-squared). The model fits best in the eastern section of the city and progressively weakens moving westward. Of the three classes of variables used, place-based variables were identified as most significant in the exploratory regression analysis, followed by economic variables. No social variables were identified. The results indicate that place-based characteristics are the best predictors of future gentrifying potential and could give clues to policymakers in which areas are most at-risk and adjust policies and incentives appropriately. It would also be worth exploring policy and cultural variables, such as number of re-zoning applications, CAC’s, and cultural spaces, event hubs, and organizations in the city to see if, and how they may hinder or spur gentrification.
