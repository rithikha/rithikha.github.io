									<b>TUTORIAL 1</b>
									In this tutorial we became more familiar with ArcMap’s capabilities by mapping heart diseases hotspots in southeastern US. The process involved
									obtaining health data from <a href ="https://wonder.cdc.gov/">CDC Wonder</a>, prepping and cleaning the data for analysis, learning how to use
									model builder to automate iterative processes, and creating an animation of heart disease hotspots over 18 years.

									<b>LAB 1: EXPLORING FRAGSTATS</b>

	<i>Specific Software/Tools: Fragstats</i>
<br>
<br>
	In this lab we learned how to use Fragstats to analyze land use change in Edmonton, Alberta. The process included downloading land cover data from the Canada
	Land Use Monitoring Program (CLUMP) for the years 1966 and 1976, and creating a transition matrix of the change that occurred over this period of time.

			<div class="col-8"><span class="image fit"><img src="images/pic08.png" alt="Lab 1 map" /></span></div>
		</div>
	</div>

<i>Results Summary</i>
<br>
<br>
<ol>
	<li>Urban built-up area expanded significantly. Only 35.63% of this land use area came from previous urban built land, while 38.88% was previously cropland and
		13.51% unimproved pasture and rangeland</li>
<li>Mines, Quarries, Sand, and Gravel Pits have expanded in the area with 63.58% of this 1976 land use occurring in areas which were previously cropland</li>
<li>Non-productive woodland area increased, however fragmentation of this land use also increased</li>
<br>
<i>Recommendations</i>
<br>
<br>
It is recommended that the city adopt measures to curb urban sprawl. Policies should be introduced that make land use within the city more efficient and aid
in decreasing the centripetal forces which push the city’s border outwards and fragment farmland and woodland. Housing policy will likely be an important factor
in mitigating sprawl, so thought should be given to how housing and living costs can be made more accessible and affordable within the city limits. Acknowledging
ecosystem services will also be beneficial in the long run, as areas classified as productive and unproductive woodland, swamps, marshes, bogs, and rockland carry
 economic benefits which are seldom realized until they have been degraded. The results indicate that the city is pushing towards more oil and gas exploration and
 extraction efforts, therefore it is of the utmost importance that environmental protection measures are put in place, such as pollution taxes to national and
 foreign companies wishing to set-up near the city. If the economic value of these land uses were quantified however, this could also pave the way forward for a
 new sector of renewable energy infrastructure and demand.

<b>LAB 2: GEOGRAPHICALLY WEIGHTED REGRESSION</b>

<i>Specific Software/Tools: ESRI Spatial Analyst Regression tools</i>
<br>
<br>
A geographically weighted regression (GWR) was used to create a model for predicting a child’s social scores. Thirteen independent variables were initially identified:
<div class="box alt">
	<div class="row gtr-uniform">
		<div class="col-5"><span class="image fit"><img src="images/pic09.png" alt="Lab 2 map" /></span></div>
	</div>
</div>

The following steps were taken to determine which variables would best predict a child’s social score and see how the prediction value of these variables changed
over space:

<ol>
	<li>Exploratory Regression (to isolate significant independent variables)</li>
<li>Ordinary Least Squares Regression (to estimate global model parameters)</li>
<li>Geographically Weighted Regression (to estimate local variation in model fit)</li>
<li>Grouping Analysis</li>
</ol>

From the exploratory regression results, the model using the income, gender, and language score variables had the highest R-squared value and lowest AICc,
indicating that these variables are the best predictors of a child’s social score, and display the least amount of multicollinearity. From the OLS, the coefficients
of the equation were as expected, with social scores increasing as language skills and income increase and for the binary gender variable, decreasing if the child
is female (likely due to human bias and gender stereotypes).
<br>
<br>
<div class="box alt">
	<div class="row gtr-uniform">
		<div class="col-8"><span class="image fit"><img src="images/pic10.png" alt="Lab 2 " /></span></div>
	</div>
</div>

The GWR local R-squared values are the highest in the upper to mid-eastern sections of the city as well as near Downtown and Kitsilano.
 These areas are where the model is performing well. The lowest local R-squared values are found near the upper right and middle section of the city,
 as well as near point grey, indicating that the local regression model does not fit the observed social score values well.
<br>
<br>

		<div class="col-6"><span class="image fit"><img src="images/pic12.png" alt="Lab 2 " /></span></div>
 	</div>
 </div>

 Finally in order to better interpret the GWR results, ESRI’s grouping analysis tool was used to create 4 distinct groups. These groups were based on the Childcare,
  Fam4, LoneParent, RecImmig and Income variables, and highlight the different demographics found in the city.   There is a clear spatial split between East
	(Group 4) and West Vancouver (Group 2), as well as the area consisting of the UBC area, Kitsilano and part of Downtown (Group 1). Group 3, very well off,
	 2-parent families with more than one child (and at least one stay at home parent) are dispersed throughout the city, though they tend to live more in the
	  middle/western area than the eastern half.

	<b>LAB 3: CRIME ANALYSIS </b> <i>Specific Software/Tools: Crimestat</i>
	<br>
	GIS plays an important role in crime analysis. This lab introduced us to CrimeStat, a crime mapping software program, which we used to analyze crime in
	 Ottawa. The data was sourced from the Ottawa Police Department. We analyzed the spatial distribution of various crimes occurring between January 2005 and
	 March 2006 (Residential Break and Enters, Commercial Break and Enters, Stolen Vehicles, and Robberies).
<br>
<br>
The objective of this lab was to determine if crime activity patterns show evidence of temporal and spatial clustering using:

<ul>
	<li><i>Nearest neighbour hierarchical clustering</i>(measures the spread or distribution of a value over space)</li>
	<li><i>Spatial autocorrelation statistics</i> (the degree to which one object is similar to other nearby objects)
 </li>
	<li> <i>Hotspot analysis</i>(identifying statistically significant hotspots in data)
</li>
	<li> <i>Kernel density estimation</i> (using sample points from a distribution to estimate the unknown probability distribution of a variable)
</li>
<br>
Nearest Neighbour Hierarchical (NNH) spatial clustering evaluates hot spots of criminal activity based on a minimum radius around points, in our case 1,000 metres.
 The Fuzzy analysis visualizes first order clusters from the nearest neighbour hierarchical analysis and shows the hotspots of crime. The NNH used in this analysis is
 agglomerative, meaning each observation starts in its own cluster (first order as seen in the map) and are then merged together as we move up the hierarchy (second
  order clusters and so on).
<br>
<br>
A hotspot is present in the downtown area of the City of Ottawa as shown by the two maps below. Expanding radially from this downtown hotspot, crime incidents become
less frequent, however clustering still exists in certain areas. For many cities, downtown areas are crime hubs due to the density of residential and commercial
activities, as is shown in Ottawa. The clustering shown in Figure 4 can be useful to stakeholders such as the police, in terms of determining where to best position
themselves based on crime frequency.
