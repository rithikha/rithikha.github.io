							Quantifying the Protective Value of Blue-Green Infrastructure in Disaster Mitigation</p>

							<p><img src="images/thesisgreygreen2.png" alt="overview of gray vs. green infrastructure" align="left" width="30%" length="30%">
								Almost two-thirds of the world’s most populous cities are located in areas vulnerable to sea-level rise. Even if collective human intervention limits
								 increases in global temperature to 2°C in the next 30 years, 570 cities around the world will still be affected by coastal inundation. While managed
								 retreat may be the only option for cities particularly at-risk, others must proactively implement solutions to adapt to these predicted circumstances,
								 which are quickly becoming a reality today. Known as blue-green infrastructure (BGI), the restoration and integration of natural landscapes within the
								  urban fabric is emerging as an effective alternative to, and in some cases, co-intervention with grey infrastructure, such as sea-walls and bulkheads.
							</p>
								<p>
									Using Metro Vancouver as a case study, this research is the first in the region to quantify the protective role of coastal natural infrastructure during
									disaster events. Though BGI has been implemented in a few low-wave energy sites in the Metro Vancouver area, namely along existing public beaches, British
									 Columbia’s regulatory framework does not currently support blue-green infrastructure or soft engineering approaches for disaster mitigation. As the city
									 shifts into the second phase of its sea-level rise strategy, quantifying the value of BGI in physical, social and economic terms could aid future mitigation
									  efforts and help better communicate its benefits to stakeholders beyond the scientific realm.

											In 2017, Salvador became the second most unequal city in Brazil in terms of income distribution. Due to the socio-economic challenges they face,
											many of the city's residents have no choice but to settle illegally, causing unplanned and rapid urban expansion that destabilizes the land and
											degrades the environment. As such, marginalized populations are disproportionately affected by disaster events compared to their counterparts in
											higher socio-economic strata.
											<br>
											<br>
											As part of a remote, international team, myself and 5 MBA students worked with municipal and community representatives to assess and develop
											solution proposals to the city’s 100RC Resilience Challenge:
											<br>
											<br>
											<i>“The City of Salvador, Brazil experiences regular heavy rainfall that can lead to devastating urban landslides. In the last 10 years, the Municipal
												Civil Defense and other government agencies have assisted in over 19,000 landslide related occurrences, providing support to  rebuild property and in
												many cases relocate citizens. Further engineering work is underway with federal support to stabilize landslide-prone neighborhoods, but rapid population
												 growth increases the possibility of future risks."</i>

										<h3> “We’re not trying to be rich, just trying to live better”
										<br>
										<b style="font-size:12px;"><i> Martha Schoeler, Lead Resilience Strategist for the City of Salvador </i></b>
										</h3>

										<p> Our team proposed four complementary approaches to address the physical, socio-economic, and environmental impacts of landslides and the risks these
											events pose to human life and property. In lieu of relocation efforts, the proposals put forward by our team recognize informal settlements as legitimate
											human communities nonetheless, focusing instead on strengthening neighbourhood cohesion, leveraging green infrastructure and technology, and increasing
											the capacity of residents to drive community-led and informed initiatives forward.</p>
