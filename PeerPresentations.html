A summary of interesting papers presented by my peers
<br>
<br>
LANDSCAPE ECOLOGY
<br>
<br>
Ellen Ahn presented an interesting paper by Uy and Nakagoshi (2008) which explores how land suitability analysis modelling, the ecological factor threshold method, and landscape-ecology principles can be used to better integrate green infrastructure into cities through a case study of Hanoi, Vietnam.
<br/<br>
With an interest in urban planning and ecology I found the concept of “green networks” interesting. Green networks are composed of smaller, multi-purpose green spaces which when connected/combined, enhance the roles and functions of green infrastructure in these individual units. This study specifically looked at Downtown Hanoi and found that by applying an analytical hierarchy process to determine land suitability scores (ranging from 1 to 3) they could reduce subjectiveness in their analysis, and create an effective way of identifying suitable sites for green infrastructure projects.
<br><br>
She gave the paper a 6/10 rating overall due to lack of transparency in their data sources (some were listed as unspecified) and as they did not justify or discuss certain issues, such as why their land suitability weighting scores did not add up to 1.0.

								<b>HEALTH GEOGRAPHY</b>
								<br><br>

Alex Briault presented a health geography paper on the accessibility of mental health services in southwest Montreal by Ngui and Vanasse (2012). The researchers aimed to answer two questions:
<ol>
<li>What is the current spatial distribution of mental health services in Southwest Montreal?</li>
<li>Which areas of Southwest Montreal lack mental health services and would be good candidates for introducing these services?</li>
</ol>
The results indicate that mental health services are spatially clustered, with a pattern in concentration occurring along the southwest to northeast direction (three of five health territories are located along this stretch). They also found that as distance was increased from 1 km to 3 km, the number of services available per 10,000 persons decreased from 10.9 to 1.4. The authors explained that this was due to the two-step floating catchment area (2SFCA) method used, where number of potential users also increases as catchment area increases.There is also a high correlation between distance from the central business district and accessibility to mental health services, where accessibility decreases with increasing distance from this district.
<br>
She gave the paper an 8.5/10 rating as the authors clearly acknowledged the limitations of the study, such as the possible influence of aspatial factors on mental health service accessibility, and these limitations did not detract from the study’s research questions itself, which was answered clearly.

								<b>CRIME ANALYSIS</b>
								<br><br>
Ellika Cairns presented an interesting paper exploring how areas of high crime may “spillover” into nearby areas. The paper titled The Edge Effect: Exploring High Crime Zones near Residential Neighbourhoods uses crime pattern theory and data on various “crime attractors” to investigate three questions:

<ol>
<li>Do concentrations of crime expand into surrounding, less accessible areas?</li>
<li>What are the differences in crime occuring at the edges and within the interiors of different land use types?</li>
<li>What is the permeability of edges of single family residential zones?</li>
</ol>

The analysis started with geocoding street addresses, and then identified the boundaries between the edges and interiors of regions. Crime density for these two types of regions were then calculated to create a crime density decay graph plotting distance from the zone boundary against crime density. The results supported crime pattern and edge theory as there were higher, though not uniformly distributed) crime rates along edges (64% more) than in interior areas.
<br><br>
She gave the paper an 8/10 rating due to the lack of discussion on sources of error and the role of socio-economic characteristics in the edge areas in influencing crime density. The authors also did not include many visualizations of the tabled results which would have improved the communication of their findings.
