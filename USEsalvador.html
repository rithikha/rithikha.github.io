							<div>
							<p>
								In 2017, Salvador became the second most unequal city in Brazil in terms of income distribution. Due to the socio-economic challenges they face,
								many of the city's residents have no choice but to settle illegally, causing unplanned and rapid urban expansion that destabilizes the land and
								degrades the environment. As such, marginalized populations are disproportionately affected by disaster events compared to their counterparts in
								higher socio-economic strata.
								<br>
								<br>
								As part of a remote, international team, myself and 5 MBA students worked with municipal and community representatives to assess and develop
								solution proposals to the city’s 100RC Resilience Challenge:
								<br>
								<br>
								<i>“The City of Salvador, Brazil experiences regular heavy rainfall that can lead to devastating urban landslides. In the last 10 years, the Municipal
									Civil Defense and other government agencies have assisted in over 19,000 landslide related occurrences, providing support to  rebuild property and in
									many cases relocate citizens. Further engineering work is underway with federal support to stabilize landslide-prone neighborhoods, but rapid population
									 growth increases the possibility of future risks."</i>
							</p>
							<br>
							<h3> “We’re not trying to be rich, just trying to live better”
							<br>
							<b style="font-size:12px;"><i> Martha Schoeler, Lead Resilience Strategist for the City of Salvador </i></b>
							</h3>

							<p> Our team proposed four complementary approaches to address the physical, socio-economic, and environmental impacts of landslides and the risks these
								events pose to human life and property. In lieu of relocation efforts, the proposals put forward by our team recognize informal settlements as legitimate
								human communities nonetheless, focusing instead on strengthening neighbourhood cohesion, leveraging green infrastructure and technology, and increasing
								the capacity of residents to drive community-led and informed initiatives forward.</p>
